In this readMe file, I talk about the assignment.

This assignment introduces to the jQuery User Interface (UI) library. The purpose of doing
this is to explore yet another JavaScript library to see its similarities and differences as compared
to the library that we have already looked at: the jQuery Validator plugin. The more of these
libraries you look at, the better understanding you will have about how they are built. And the
better you understand that, the better you will be able to construct an industry-standard library
yourself.
PART 2: jQuery UI Slider and Tab Widgets
This part will look at two jQuery UI components: the slider and the tabbed interface. You could
use the HTML5 slider, and I know that some of you have already programmed your own tabbed
interface for previous assignments, either from scratch or using a different JavaScript
library. However for this assignment you must use the components in the jQuery UI library.
